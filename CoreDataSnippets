Q]Types of Core Data Concurrency
A] MainQueueConcurrencyType: Specifies that the managed object context will be associated with the main queue.
NSMainQueueConcurrencyType is specifically for use with your application interface 
and can only be used on the main queue of an application.

let mainMOC = NSManagedObjectContext(concurrencyType: .MainQueueConcurrencyType)

NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType:Specifies that themanaged object context will be associated with a private dispatch queue.
In general, avoid doing data processing on the main queue that is not user-related. 
Data processing can be CPU-intensive, and if it is performed on the main queue, it can result in unresponsiveness in the UI.
If your application will be processing data, such as importing data into Core Data from JSON, 
create a private queue context and perform the import on the private context.

let privateMOC = NSManagedObjectContext(concurrencyType: .PrivateQueueConcurrencyType)
